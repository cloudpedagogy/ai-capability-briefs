## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for professionals working in media, journalism, publishing, and editorial contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes research, writing, editing, distribution, and audience engagement.

It is intended for roles including:

- journalists, editors, and newsroom leaders  
- publishers and editorial strategists  
- investigative and data journalism teams  
- digital media and content governance roles  
- public-interest and non-profit media organisations  

This is not a guide to content automation or AI writing tools.  
It is a capability briefing to support editorial judgement, public trust, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of knowledge production and dissemination.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for media and publishing

Media and publishing operate as core democratic institutions. AI is increasingly used to:

- assist research and background analysis  
- draft or edit text at scale  
- personalise or optimise content distribution  
- analyse audience behaviour and engagement  

Decisions made in these contexts:

- shape public understanding and discourse  
- influence political, cultural, and social outcomes  
- carry reputational and legal risk  
- rely heavily on trust and credibility  

Without explicit AI capability, media organisations risk:

- undermining editorial integrity  
- blurring boundaries between reporting and generation  
- amplifying misinformation or bias  
- eroding public confidence in journalism  

AI capability ensures that AI enhances editorial capacity without compromising credibility.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported media work

Across media and publishing contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **False authority:** fluent AI-generated text mistaken for verified reporting  
- **Source opacity:** unclear provenance of AI-assisted research  
- **Speed pressure:** publication velocity overriding verification  
- **Editorial dilution:** automation eroding human judgement  
- **Bias amplification:** dominant narratives reinforced at scale  
- **Transparency gaps:** unclear disclosure of AI involvement  

These risks directly affect public trust.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in media and publishing

The AI Capability Framework provides a structured lens for maintaining editorial integrity in AI-shaped media environments.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Media professionals need a clear understanding of how AI generates, aggregates, and reframes information.

This includes:

- recognising hallucination and synthesis risks  
- understanding limitations in sourcing and facticity  
- avoiding assumptions that fluency equals truth  

This domain supports sceptical, journalistic scrutiny.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Editorial responsibility must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring editors and journalists retain ownership of claims  
- treating AI outputs as drafts or research aids  
- maintaining clear accountability for published content  

Clear co-agency protects editorial independence.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support responsible innovation in media work.

This domain supports:

- investigative support through pattern exploration  
- accessibility and translation with editorial oversight  
- audience analysis that informs but does not dictate content  

Innovation must reinforce, not replace, editorial judgement.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Media ethics are foundational to democratic life.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- avoiding harm through misrepresentation or stereotyping  
- recognising how AI may marginalise minority voices  
- preventing amplification of misinformation or disinformation  

Ethical journalism requires care, especially at scale.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Media organisations face legal and reputational scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- defining editorial standards for AI use  
- documenting verification and review processes  
- aligning AI practices with journalistic codes and law  

Good governance sustains credibility and independence.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Media norms evolve rapidly.

Capability is strengthened when organisations:

- review the impact of AI on editorial quality  
- learn from errors, corrections, and audience feedback  
- adapt policies as tools and expectations change  

This domain supports resilient, trusted journalism.

---

## 5. Practical actions for media, journalism, and publishing

The following actions strengthen AI capability in media contexts:

- **Treat AI outputs as unverified**  
  Apply full editorial scrutiny.

- **Protect source integrity**  
  Verify provenance and attribution rigorously.

- **Define disclosure standards**  
  Be clear when AI assisted production.

- **Maintain editorial oversight**  
  Ensure humans retain final say.

- **Monitor impact on trust**  
  Track corrections, complaints, and audience confidence.

- **Update standards regularly**  
  Treat AI policy as a living document.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in media and publishing

Media organisations with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent editorial processes  
- consistent verification standards  
- ethical sensitivity to public impact  
- resilience under legal or reputational challenge  
- sustained audience trust  
- learning-oriented newsroom culture  

These signals reflect journalistic maturity, not automation scale.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to media, journalism, and publishing contexts.

To deepen this work, organisations may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on ethics and public impact  
- the Application Handbook for organisational governance  
- facilitated editorial policy workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Media and publishing provide truth-seeking, accountability, and public trust.
