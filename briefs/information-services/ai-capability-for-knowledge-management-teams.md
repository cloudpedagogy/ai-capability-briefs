## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Knowledge Management (KM), Organisational Learning, and Knowledge Strategy teams responsible for capturing, curating, sharing, and sustaining organisational knowledge in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes how knowledge is created, retrieved, interpreted, and reused.

It is intended for teams involved in:

- knowledge capture and curation  
- organisational memory and learning systems  
- internal guidance, playbooks, and repositories  
- decision-support knowledge assets  
- communities of practice and expertise sharing  

This is not a technical guide to AI search tools or knowledge bots.  
It is a capability briefing to support judgement, coherence, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of organisational knowledge infrastructure.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for knowledge management

Knowledge management sits at the intersection of information, judgement, and organisational power. AI is increasingly used to:

- summarise and synthesise large knowledge bases  
- support semantic search and retrieval  
- generate guidance or decision-support content  
- connect people to expertise and precedent  

Decisions shaped by KM systems:

- influence how staff interpret policy and evidence  
- shape consistency and quality of decision-making  
- affect organisational learning and memory  
- carry reputational and governance implications  

Without explicit AI capability, KM systems risk becoming:

- authoritative but inaccurate  
- efficient but misleading  
- persuasive without accountability  
- opaque in how guidance is generated  

AI capability ensures that AI enhances organisational intelligence without displacing human judgement.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-enabled knowledge management

Across organisations, recurring challenges appear:

- **False authority:** AI-generated guidance treated as policy  
- **Context collapse:** nuanced knowledge flattened into generic summaries  
- **Source opacity:** unclear provenance of AI-synthesised content  
- **Knowledge drift:** AI reshaping norms without formal approval  
- **Over-centralisation:** concentration of interpretive power in systems  
- **Stale learning:** outdated or superseded knowledge resurfacing  

These risks undermine trust in organisational knowledge.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in knowledge management

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for managing AI-mediated organisational knowledge.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

KM teams need a clear understanding of how AI retrieves, synthesises, and reframes knowledge.

This includes:

- recognising probabilistic and generative behaviour  
- understanding limits in contextual reasoning  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs reflect organisational consensus  

This domain supports critical stewardship rather than automation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Authority over organisational knowledge must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain ownership of guidance and interpretation  
- treating AI outputs as aids, not official positions  
- clarifying accountability for knowledge-based decisions  

Clear co-agency protects organisational coherence and legitimacy.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support scalable knowledge access when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- improving discoverability of existing knowledge  
- supporting learning across silos  
- enabling exploratory synthesis with expert oversight  

Innovation is beneficial when accuracy and alignment are preserved.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Knowledge systems shape who is heard and whose expertise counts.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising whose knowledge is prioritised or marginalised  
- avoiding reinforcement of dominant perspectives only  
- ensuring inclusive representation of expertise and experience  

Ethical KM practice requires attention to power and voice.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Knowledge outputs influence decisions at scale.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI-generated knowledge was produced  
- aligning KM practices with governance, policy, and risk frameworks  
- ensuring guidance can be challenged and reviewed  

Good governance protects against unaccountable authority.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Organisational knowledge must evolve.

Capability is strengthened when KM teams:

- review how AI influences learning and behaviour  
- identify gaps, distortions, or unintended effects  
- update systems as knowledge and priorities change  

This domain supports living, trustworthy knowledge systems.

---

## 5. Practical actions for knowledge management teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in KM contexts:

- **Clarify status of AI outputs**  
  Distinguish guidance, draft, and authoritative content.

- **Preserve provenance**  
  Make sources and lineage visible.

- **Support contestability**  
  Enable challenge and feedback on AI-generated knowledge.

- **Align with governance**  
  Ensure KM systems reflect approved policy and practice.

- **Monitor use and impact**  
  Observe how knowledge is interpreted and applied.

- **Review and refresh regularly**  
  Treat AI-enabled KM as iterative, not fixed.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in knowledge management

KM functions with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- trusted, coherent organisational guidance  
- transparency about sources and limitations  
- alignment between knowledge, policy, and practice  
- resilience under audit or challenge  
- inclusive representation of expertise  
- learning-oriented system evolution  

These signals reflect organisational intelligence, not technical sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to knowledge management contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides related to governance and decision-making  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated reviews of knowledge systems and practices  

The Framework provides structure.  
Knowledge management teams provide coherence, learning, and judgement.
