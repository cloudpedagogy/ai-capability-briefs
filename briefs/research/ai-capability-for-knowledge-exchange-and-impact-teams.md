## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Knowledge Exchange (KE), Impact, Engagement, Innovation, and Partnerships teams who support the translation of research into policy, practice, products, and public benefit in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes how knowledge is communicated, interpreted, and applied.

It is intended for teams that:

- support research impact and engagement strategies  
- broker partnerships with industry, government, and communities  
- advise on pathways to impact and evaluation  
- translate research outputs for non-academic audiences  

This is not a communications toolkit or an AI marketing guide.  
It is a capability briefing to support ethical judgement, credibility, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of research translation and impact work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for knowledge exchange and impact

AI is increasingly used to:

- translate complex research for diverse audiences  
- generate summaries, policy briefs, and narratives  
- support stakeholder mapping and engagement planning  
- analyse impact evidence and reporting  

Knowledge exchange teams operate at the boundary between research and society. Their decisions shape:

- how research is represented  
- who benefits from it  
- how trust is built or eroded  

Without explicit AI capability, KE and impact work risks becoming:

- over-simplified or misleading  
- detached from research nuance  
- vulnerable to reputational or ethical challenge  
- uneven across partnerships and contexts  

AI capability enables teams to harness efficiency while protecting integrity and trust.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported knowledge exchange

Across institutions, recurring challenges appear:

- **Oversimplification:** AI-generated narratives flattening complexity  
- **Misrepresentation:** research claims reframed beyond evidence  
- **Attribution blur:** unclear authorship or contribution in AI-assisted outputs  
- **Equity drift:** privileging voices and audiences already well served  
- **Partner mismatch:** AI-generated materials misaligned with stakeholder context  
- **Impact inflation:** overstated claims driven by automated reporting  

These risks undermine credibility if not actively managed.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in knowledge exchange

The AI Capability Framework provides a structured lens for responsible AI use in impact and engagement work.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

KE teams need a grounded understanding of how AI generates and frames content.

This includes:

- recognising tendencies toward generic or persuasive language  
- understanding limits of AI-generated interpretation  
- avoiding assumptions that fluency equals accuracy  

This domain supports critical review, not content production alone.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Responsibility for representation must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain ownership of claims and narratives  
- treating AI outputs as drafts requiring expert validation  
- resisting pressure to scale impact reporting without scrutiny  

Clear co-agency protects credibility and accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support creative and scalable engagement when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- exploring multiple framing options for different audiences  
- supporting rapid iteration with expert oversight  
- enhancing accessibility and reach without distorting meaning  

Innovation becomes harmful when speed overrides judgement.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Knowledge exchange shapes power and influence.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- considering whose knowledge is amplified or marginalised  
- avoiding extractive or instrumental use of communities  
- ensuring AI-assisted outputs do not mislead or over-claim  

Ethical KE practice requires reflexivity and responsibility.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Impact work is increasingly scrutinised.

AI capability here involves:

- aligning AI-assisted outputs with institutional and funder expectations  
- documenting how claims were developed and validated  
- ensuring transparency in reporting and evaluation  

Good governance supports trust across partnerships.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Engagement practices evolve alongside tools and expectations.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review AI-assisted outputs for accuracy and reception  
- learn from partner and public feedback  
- update practices as norms and risks change  

This domain supports sustainable, trusted impact work.

---

## 5. Practical actions for knowledge exchange and impact teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in KE and impact roles:

- **Treat AI outputs as drafts**  
  Validate claims against research evidence.

- **Protect nuance deliberately**  
  Avoid oversimplification for convenience.

- **Clarify attribution**  
  Be transparent about AI-assisted production where relevant.

- **Contextualise engagement**  
  Adapt outputs to audience and partnership needs.

- **Document validation steps**  
  Record how AI-assisted materials were reviewed.

- **Align with research teams**  
  Maintain close collaboration with researchers.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in knowledge exchange

KE and impact teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- credible, accurate public-facing outputs  
- confidence under scrutiny from partners or funders  
- ethical and inclusive engagement practices  
- transparency in reporting and claims  
- trust sustained across diverse audiences  
- reflective improvement over time  

These signals reflect reputational maturity, not technological reach.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to knowledge exchange and impact contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and public impact  
- the Application Handbook for structured implementation  
- facilitated workshops with research and engagement staff  

The Framework provides structure.  
Knowledge exchange teams provide translation, judgement, and trust.
