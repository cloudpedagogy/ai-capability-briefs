## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Data Stewards, Research Data Managers, Library and Information Professionals, and Research Data Services teams responsible for supporting the collection, management, governance, and reuse of research data in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes data practices.

It is intended for roles that:

- advise on data management planning and compliance  
- support FAIR and responsible data practices  
- steward sensitive, personal, or high-risk datasets  
- enable data sharing, preservation, and reuse  

This is not a technical manual on machine learning or data infrastructure.  
It is a capability briefing to support sound judgement, ethical stewardship, and defensible decision-making when AI interacts with research data across its lifecycle.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for data stewardship and research data services

AI systems depend on data — often at scale — and research data services sit at critical control points where decisions shape downstream use.

Data stewards are increasingly asked to:

- advise on AI use in data analysis and reuse  
- assess risks associated with secondary or generative use of data  
- interpret consent, licensing, and governance in AI contexts  
- balance openness with privacy, sensitivity, and harm prevention  

Without explicit AI capability, data services risk becoming either overly restrictive or inadvertently permissive.

AI capability enables data stewards to protect data subjects, researchers, and institutions while supporting responsible innovation.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-influenced data stewardship

Across research environments, recurring challenges appear:

- **Consent drift:** data used in ways not anticipated by original consent  
- **Opacity of reuse:** difficulty tracking how AI systems transform data  
- **Licensing mismatch:** unclear compatibility between licences and AI training  
- **Bias amplification:** historical data reinforcing inequity through AI  
- **Governance gaps:** AI use falling between existing data policies  
- **Role overload:** responsibility without authority in high-risk decisions  

These risks are structural and require capability-led responses.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in data stewardship

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled lens for managing AI–data interactions responsibly.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Data stewards need a practical understanding of how AI uses and transforms data.

This includes:

- recognising how data may be repurposed in AI training or analysis  
- understanding limits of anonymisation in AI contexts  
- avoiding assumptions that “open” always means “risk-free”  

This domain supports informed stewardship, not technical operation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Data governance decisions must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans remain accountable for data decisions  
- resisting narratives that treat AI data use as inevitable or neutral  
- clarifying responsibility boundaries between services and researchers  

Clear co-agency protects ethical and legal accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support new forms of data use and insight.

This domain supports:

- enabling responsible secondary analysis  
- supporting innovation within ethical and legal constraints  
- advising on safeguards and proportional controls  

Innovation is sustainable when stewardship principles are explicit.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Data decisions have real-world consequences.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising whose data is used and who bears risk  
- addressing historical bias embedded in datasets  
- considering downstream impacts of data-driven AI outputs  

Ethical data stewardship requires foresight, not post hoc correction.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Data stewards operate at governance boundaries.

AI capability here involves:

- aligning advice with data protection, ethics, and institutional policy  
- documenting decisions where AI-related risk is assessed  
- knowing when to escalate high-risk or ambiguous cases  

Good governance supports defensibility under scrutiny.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Data practices evolve alongside technology.

Capability is strengthened when data services:

- review how AI-related data decisions play out over time  
- learn from incidents, audits, and emerging guidance  
- update policies and practices iteratively  

This domain supports resilient, future-ready data stewardship.

---

## 5. Practical actions for data stewards and research data services

The following actions strengthen AI capability in data stewardship roles:

- **Interrogate data reuse assumptions**  
  Examine how AI may change data meaning or risk.

- **Clarify consent and licensing**  
  Ensure alignment with AI-enabled use cases.

- **Document high-risk decisions**  
  Maintain clear records of judgement and rationale.

- **Support researcher understanding**  
  Translate complex governance into usable guidance.

- **Escalate proportionately**  
  Involve ethics or governance bodies when needed.

- **Share learning across services**  
  Build collective capability rather than isolated expertise.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in data stewardship

Research environments with strong AI capability in data services typically demonstrate:

- clear, consistent guidance on AI–data interactions  
- ethical and legal alignment across projects  
- confidence in handling sensitive or high-risk data  
- transparency in decision-making  
- trust from researchers and participants  
- adaptive improvement of data governance practices  

These signals reflect stewardship maturity, not restriction.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to research data stewardship and services.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on research and high-risk contexts  
- the Application Handbook for institutional implementation  
- cross-functional data governance workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Data stewards provide ethical judgement, protection, and enablement.
