## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for members of Grant Review Panels, Funding Assessors, Peer Review Committees, and related bodies responsible for evaluating research proposals in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly influences proposal development, evaluation, and decision-making.

It is intended for assessors who:

- review funding applications and proposals  
- make comparative judgements under competitive conditions  
- operate within funder policies and criteria  
- contribute to allocation of limited research resources  

This is not a funder policy statement or a technical guide to AI tools.  
It is a capability briefing to support fair evaluation, consistency, and defensible judgement when AI shapes both the preparation and assessment of research proposals.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for grant review and assessment

AI is increasingly used by applicants to:

- refine research questions and framing  
- draft and edit proposals  
- summarise prior literature  
- shape impact narratives and work plans  

At the same time, assessors may be asked to:

- judge proposals that appear highly polished but uneven in substance  
- infer originality or contribution in AI-assisted text  
- compare applications prepared under very different AI conditions  
- maintain fairness without penalising legitimate support  

Without explicit AI capability, grant review processes risk:

- bias toward stylistic polish rather than research quality  
- inconsistent judgements across panels  
- unintended disadvantage to applicants with less AI literacy  
- erosion of trust in funding decisions  

AI capability enables assessors to focus on substance, rigour, and contribution rather than surface features.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-influenced grant review

Across funding contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Style bias:** over-weighting fluency or coherence in proposals  
- **Assumed misconduct:** suspicion of AI use without evidence or policy basis  
- **Uneven expectations:** different assessors applying different standards  
- **Originality confusion:** difficulty distinguishing idea generation from expression  
- **Equity impacts:** disadvantaging applicants with limited AI access or guidance  
- **Process drift:** informal changes to evaluation practice without review  

These risks undermine the legitimacy of funding decisions if not addressed.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in grant assessment

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled lens for evaluating AI-shaped proposals fairly.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Assessors need a realistic understanding of how AI supports proposal development.

This includes:

- recognising common uses of AI in drafting and editing  
- understanding limitations of AI-generated framing  
- avoiding assumptions that AI use equates to reduced originality  

This domain supports informed interpretation, not detection.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Assessment authority must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring AI does not substitute for critical evaluation  
- retaining responsibility for judgement of merit and feasibility  
- resisting pressure to normalise automated scoring or filtering  

Clear co-agency protects the integrity of peer review.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Funding processes must adapt without losing rigour.

This domain supports:

- evolving assessment criteria to emphasise substance and clarity  
- recognising legitimate support tools used by applicants  
- distinguishing strong ideas from polished presentation  

Innovation here strengthens fairness rather than speed.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Funding decisions have structural consequences.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising how AI access may advantage some applicants  
- avoiding penalisation for legitimate, disclosed AI support  
- ensuring diversity and inclusion considerations remain central  

Ethical assessment requires awareness of systemic effects.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Grant review panels operate under scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- aligning decisions with published criteria and guidance  
- documenting rationale where AI-related considerations arise  
- supporting defensible outcomes under appeal or audit  

Good governance sustains trust in funding systems.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Assessment norms evolve over time.

Capability is strengthened when panels:

- reflect on patterns in AI-influenced submissions  
- review criteria and guidance periodically  
- share learning across assessment cycles  

This domain supports continuous improvement in evaluation practice.

---

## 5. Practical actions for grant review panels and assessors

The following actions strengthen AI capability in funding assessment:

- **Focus on substance over polish**  
  Prioritise research quality, feasibility, and contribution.

- **Avoid assumption-based judgements**  
  Do not infer misconduct from style or fluency alone.

- **Align standards across panels**  
  Use shared principles to reduce inconsistency.

- **Document evaluation rationale**  
  Make explicit how decisions were reached.

- **Surface equity considerations**  
  Reflect on structural impacts of assessment practices.

- **Feed learning into guidance**  
  Support funder updates based on experience.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in grant assessment

Funding systems with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- consistent, transparent evaluation decisions  
- emphasis on research substance rather than presentation  
- fairness across disciplines and applicant backgrounds  
- resilience under scrutiny or appeal  
- confidence among applicants and assessors  
- adaptive improvement over funding cycles  

These signals reflect assessment integrity, not conservatism.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to grant review and assessment contexts.

To deepen this work, panels may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on research governance  
- the Application Handbook for institutional use  
- facilitated reviewer calibration sessions  

The Framework provides structure.  
Grant assessors provide judgement, fairness, and legitimacy.
