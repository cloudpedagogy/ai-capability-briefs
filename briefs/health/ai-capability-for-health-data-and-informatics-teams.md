## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Health Data, Informatics, Analytics, and Digital Health teams responsible for managing, analysing, and governing health data in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes insight generation, decision support, and system design.

It is intended for teams involved in:

- health data management and analytics  
- informatics and digital health infrastructure  
- reporting, dashboards, and performance insight  
- data governance, quality, and interoperability  
- supporting clinical, managerial, and policy decision-making  

This is not a technical guide to machine learning models or analytics platforms.  
It is a capability briefing to support ethical judgement, data stewardship, and defensible decision-making when AI interacts with health data at scale.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for health data and informatics teams

Health data teams operate at critical junctions where data becomes insight and insight becomes action. AI is increasingly used to:

- identify patterns in complex health datasets  
- generate predictive or risk-based insights  
- automate reporting and performance monitoring  
- support planning, commissioning, and clinical pathways  

Decisions influenced by health data and AI can:

- affect patient care and population outcomes  
- shape resource allocation  
- reinforce or reduce health inequalities  
- attract regulatory and public scrutiny  

Without explicit AI capability, data and informatics teams risk enabling decisions that are efficient but ethically fragile or poorly understood.

AI capability ensures that insight generation remains responsible, interpretable, and aligned with public interest.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-enabled health data work

Across health systems, recurring challenges appear:

- **Data bias:** historical data reflecting structural inequalities  
- **False confidence:** predictive outputs treated as certainty  
- **Opacity:** difficulty explaining AI-informed insights to non-specialists  
- **Purpose drift:** data reused beyond original intent or consent  
- **Governance gaps:** AI use falling between data and clinical oversight  
- **Role overload:** responsibility without authority over downstream use  

These risks are systemic and require capability-led responses.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in health data and informatics

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for managing AI–data interactions in health contexts.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Health data teams need a shared understanding of how AI uses and transforms data.

This includes:

- recognising probabilistic outputs and uncertainty  
- understanding limits of data representativeness  
- avoiding assumptions that data-driven equals objective  

This domain supports critical interpretation rather than blind optimisation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Accountability for data-informed decisions must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- clarifying responsibility for interpretation and use of insights  
- ensuring AI outputs inform rather than determine decisions  
- resisting narratives that position data systems as neutral arbiters  

Clear co-agency protects accountability and trust.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can enhance health analytics when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- exploratory analysis with appropriate safeguards  
- innovation aligned to governance and ethical standards  
- collaboration across clinical, managerial, and policy teams  

Innovation is beneficial when insight remains interpretable and contestable.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Health data decisions have population-level consequences.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining differential impacts across groups  
- recognising bias embedded in datasets and models  
- ensuring data use does not exacerbate inequality  

Ethical data practice is a public responsibility.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Health data teams operate within complex governance environments.

AI capability here involves:

- aligning AI-enabled analytics with legal and regulatory obligations  
- documenting assumptions and limitations of insights  
- supporting transparency for audit, review, and public accountability  

Good governance ensures defensible use of health data.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Health data ecosystems evolve continuously.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review outcomes of AI-informed insights  
- learn from misuse, misinterpretation, or unintended consequences  
- update practices as evidence and standards evolve  

This domain supports sustainable, trustworthy informatics practice.

---

## 5. Practical actions for health data and informatics teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in health data contexts:

- **Make uncertainty visible**  
  Communicate confidence levels and limitations clearly.

- **Interrogate data sources**  
  Examine who is represented and who is missing.

- **Clarify purpose and reuse**  
  Ensure alignment with consent and governance.

- **Support interpretability**  
  Enable users to understand and question outputs.

- **Document assumptions**  
  Record how data and AI shaped insights.

- **Collaborate across roles**  
  Work closely with clinicians, managers, and policymakers.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in health data and informatics

Health data functions with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent, interpretable analytics  
- ethical and equity-aware data use  
- confidence under regulatory scrutiny  
- trust from clinical and managerial partners  
- alignment between data, governance, and outcomes  
- learning-oriented improvement over time  

These signals reflect stewardship maturity, not analytical complexity.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to health data and informatics contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on health and high-impact data use  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- cross-functional data governance workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Health data and informatics teams provide insight, stewardship, and accountability.
