## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Health Service Managers, Commissioners, and senior operational leaders responsible for planning, funding, and overseeing health services in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes service design, prioritisation, and performance management.

It is intended for roles involved in:

- commissioning and contracting health services  
- service planning and transformation  
- performance monitoring and quality improvement  
- resource allocation and prioritisation  
- partnership working across health and care systems  

This is not a clinical decision guide or a technical overview of health AI systems.  
It is a capability briefing to support accountable judgement, system-level thinking, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of health service management and commissioning.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for health service management and commissioning

AI is increasingly used to:

- forecast demand and service utilisation  
- support prioritisation and pathway design  
- analyse performance and outcomes  
- inform commissioning and investment decisions  

Health service managers and commissioners operate at points where decisions:

- affect large populations  
- shape equity of access and outcomes  
- involve public funds and accountability  
- are subject to regulatory and public scrutiny  

Without explicit AI capability, there is a risk that AI-informed decisions:

- reinforce existing inequalities  
- obscure accountability for outcomes  
- prioritise efficiency over care quality  
- reduce transparency in public decision-making  

AI capability ensures that AI supports sustainable, equitable, and person-centred health systems.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-informed service management

Across health systems, recurring challenges appear:

- **Over-optimisation:** efficiency gains pursued at the expense of care quality  
- **Data bias:** population data masking unmet or marginalised needs  
- **Commissioning opacity:** difficulty explaining AI-influenced decisions  
- **Vendor dependence:** reliance on proprietary tools without governance clarity  
- **Fragmentation:** AI initiatives misaligned across services or pathways  
- **Equity drift:** unintended widening of health inequalities  

These risks are systemic rather than technical.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in health service management

The AI Capability Framework provides a structured lens for responsible AI use at system level.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Managers and commissioners need a shared understanding of AI’s role in health systems.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty and assumptions in models and forecasts  
- understanding limits of prediction in complex health environments  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs represent objective truth  

This domain supports informed oversight rather than technical control.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Accountability for health system decisions must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring decision authority rests with accountable leaders  
- clarifying where AI informs rather than determines choices  
- resisting pressure to defer responsibility to systems or suppliers  

Clear co-agency underpins public trust and governance.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in service design when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- piloting AI-enabled service improvements with safeguards  
- aligning innovation with clinical, operational, and ethical standards  
- learning from evidence rather than scaling prematurely  

Innovation must be proportionate to risk and impact.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Health service decisions have profound ethical implications.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining equity impacts across populations  
- recognising structural bias in health data  
- ensuring vulnerable groups are not disadvantaged  

Ethical stewardship is a core responsibility of commissioners and managers.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Health systems operate within complex governance environments.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influences commissioning and planning decisions  
- aligning practice with regulatory, legal, and policy frameworks  
- supporting transparency and accountability under scrutiny  

Good governance sustains confidence in health system leadership.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Health systems must adapt continuously.

Capability is strengthened when leaders:

- review outcomes of AI-informed decisions  
- learn from patient, clinician, and community feedback  
- update approaches as evidence and context evolve  

This domain supports resilient, learning-oriented health systems.

---

## 5. Practical actions for health service managers and commissioners

The following actions strengthen AI capability in health service leadership roles:

- **Interrogate assumptions**  
  Examine the data and logic behind AI-informed recommendations.

- **Protect equity explicitly**  
  Assess differential impacts on populations and communities.

- **Clarify accountability**  
  Be clear who owns AI-informed decisions and outcomes.

- **Align partners and suppliers**  
  Require transparency and governance from vendors.

- **Document decision rationale**  
  Record how AI considerations shaped commissioning choices.

- **Review and adapt**  
  Treat AI use as subject to continuous evaluation.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in health service management

Health systems with strong AI capability at management level typically demonstrate:

- transparent and explainable planning decisions  
- equity-aware commissioning and investment  
- alignment between strategy, operations, and care quality  
- confidence under regulatory and public scrutiny  
- sustained trust from communities and partners  
- learning-oriented system improvement  

These signals reflect stewardship maturity, not technological sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to health service management and commissioning contexts.

To deepen this work, leaders may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on health and high-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for system-level implementation  
- facilitated cross-system capability reviews  

The Framework provides structure.  
Health service leaders provide stewardship, equity, and public accountability.
