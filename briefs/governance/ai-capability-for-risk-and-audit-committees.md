## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for members of Risk Committees, Audit Committees, Internal Audit functions, and related assurance bodies responsible for overseeing organisational risk, control environments, and accountability in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes decision-making and operational processes.

It is intended for committees that:

- oversee enterprise risk and assurance frameworks  
- review internal controls and audit findings  
- assess compliance, resilience, and preparedness  
- provide independent challenge to executive management  

This is not a technical risk register or an AI compliance checklist.  
It is a capability briefing to support proportionate assurance, informed challenge, and defensible oversight when AI introduces new forms of risk and uncertainty.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for risk and audit oversight

AI reshapes risk profiles by introducing:

- opaque decision pathways  
- probabilistic and adaptive behaviour  
- scale and speed that amplify impact  
- dependencies on data quality and governance  

Risk and audit committees are increasingly asked to:

- assure AI-enabled processes without full transparency  
- assess whether controls remain effective  
- judge the adequacy of management assurance  
- respond to regulatory and public scrutiny  

Without explicit AI capability, assurance processes risk becoming either superficial or overly procedural.

AI capability enables committees to focus on *risk substance*, not just control artefacts.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-related risk and audit activity

Across organisations, recurring challenges appear:

- **Control illusion:** traditional controls appearing robust but no longer effective  
- **Evidence mismatch:** audit artefacts not reflecting real AI-influenced practice  
- **Risk fragmentation:** AI risks split across technology, legal, and ethics silos  
- **Over-reliance on management assurance:** limited independent challenge  
- **Late detection:** issues surfaced only after harm or scrutiny  
- **Checklist drift:** procedural compliance replacing judgement  

These risks undermine assurance credibility if left unaddressed.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in risk and audit oversight

The AI Capability Framework provides a coherent lens for adapting assurance to AI-shaped environments.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Committee members need a shared understanding of how AI alters risk characteristics.

This includes:

- recognising non-deterministic and adaptive behaviour  
- understanding limits of model explainability  
- avoiding assumptions that AI risk mirrors traditional IT risk  

This domain supports informed challenge, not technical inspection.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Accountability for risk must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring clear ownership of AI-related risks  
- rejecting narratives that attribute failures to systems alone  
- maintaining executive accountability to the board  

Clear co-agency underpins effective assurance.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Risk and audit functions must evolve their methods.

This domain supports:

- adapting audit scopes and questions to AI contexts  
- focusing on decision pathways and governance, not just controls  
- enabling assurance that evolves alongside practice  

Innovation strengthens assurance when aligned with judgement.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Risk oversight must consider more than financial exposure.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- assessing ethical and societal impacts  
- recognising equity-related risks and harm amplification  
- ensuring reputational risk is not treated as secondary  

Ethical oversight is a core assurance responsibility.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Committees must be able to evidence sound oversight.

AI capability here involves:

- requiring transparency about AI-influenced decisions  
- ensuring audit trails remain meaningful  
- integrating AI risk into enterprise risk management  

Good governance is systemic, not additive.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Risk environments evolve continuously.

Capability is strengthened when committees:

- review AI-related incidents and near-misses  
- update risk appetite and assurance approaches  
- learn from internal and external developments  

This domain supports resilient, future-ready oversight.

---

## 5. Practical actions for risk and audit committees

The following actions strengthen AI capability in assurance roles:

- **Ask where judgement is automated or influenced**  
  Focus on decision points, not just systems.

- **Challenge control relevance**  
  Test whether controls still work in AI contexts.

- **Integrate AI risk coherently**  
  Avoid siloed treatment of AI issues.

- **Request scenario-based assurance**  
  Explore “what if” risks, not only compliance status.

- **Document challenge and response**  
  Record how AI risks were interrogated.

- **Review regularly**  
  Treat AI risk as dynamic, not static.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in risk and audit oversight

Risk and audit functions with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- credible, proportionate assurance  
- informed and confident challenge  
- visibility of AI-related risk pathways  
- integration of ethical and reputational considerations  
- resilience under regulatory scrutiny  
- continuous evolution of assurance practice  

These signals reflect assurance maturity, not technical control density.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to risk and audit oversight contexts.

To deepen this work, committees may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and high-risk contexts  
- the Application Handbook for assurance pathways  
- facilitated risk scenario workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Risk and audit committees provide challenge, assurance, and accountability.
