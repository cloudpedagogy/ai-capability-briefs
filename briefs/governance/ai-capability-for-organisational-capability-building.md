## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for those responsible for building, coordinating, and sustaining organisational capability in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes everyday work, decision-making, and professional judgement.

It is intended for:

- organisational development and change leads  
- learning and development teams  
- digital strategy and transformation leads  
- faculty or departmental capability leads  
- HR, workforce development, and professional learning teams  

This is not a maturity model, a training catalogue, or a technology roadmap.  
It is a capability briefing designed to support intentional, coherent, and sustainable development of AI capability across organisations.

## 2. Why AI capability matters at organisational level

Many organisations approach AI through isolated initiatives:

- tool rollouts  
- pilot projects  
- short training sessions  
- policy statements  

While often well intentioned, these approaches rarely build lasting capability. Instead, they can result in:

- uneven confidence across teams  
- duplicated effort and local workarounds  
- hidden risk accumulation  
- dependence on a small number of experts  
- fatigue and scepticism about “AI initiatives”  

AI capability at organisational level is about how people learn, decide, reflect, and adapt over time — not how quickly tools are adopted.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in organisational capability building

Across sectors, recurring challenges appear when AI capability is not addressed systemically:

- **Tool-first strategies:** prioritising platforms over judgement and practice  
- **Training-as-solution thinking:** assuming short courses equal capability  
- **Capability silos:** uneven development across roles, teams, or faculties  
- **Invisible risk accumulation:** local practices evolving without oversight  
- **Change fatigue:** repeated initiatives without clear purpose or continuity  
- **Underinvestment in reflection:** little space for learning from practice  

These issues reflect structural design problems, not resistance to change.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability to organisational development

The AI Capability Framework offers a holistic structure for building capability at scale.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Organisations need a shared baseline understanding of AI.

This includes:

- common language for discussing AI capability  
- realistic understanding of benefits and limitations  
- avoidance of hype-driven or fear-driven narratives  

This domain supports collective sense-making, not technical literacy alone.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Organisational capability depends on role clarity.

This domain involves:

- defining where responsibility sits in AI-influenced workflows  
- supporting staff to design transparent human–AI collaboration  
- avoiding implicit delegation of judgement to systems  

Clear co-agency prevents both over-reliance and under-use.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Capability grows through practice, not abstraction.

Organisations strengthen this domain by:

- enabling safe-to-fail experimentation  
- sharing learning across teams  
- aligning innovation with organisational purpose  

Innovation becomes sustainable when learning is collective and cumulative.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Capability building must address who benefits and who bears risk.

This includes:

- ensuring equitable access to capability development  
- recognising how AI may reinforce existing inequalities  
- embedding ethical reflection into routine practice  

Ethical capability is organisational, not individual.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Capability requires supporting structures.

This domain involves:

- aligning capability development with governance expectations  
- ensuring decision-making processes remain explainable  
- preventing informal or shadow AI practices from becoming entrenched  

Good governance enables capability rather than constraining it.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Long-term capability depends on learning systems.

Organisations strengthen this domain by:

- creating regular opportunities for reflection  
- reviewing how AI is reshaping work over time  
- adapting capability strategies as contexts evolve  

This domain prevents stagnation and dependency.

---

## 5. Practical actions for organisational capability builders

The following actions support sustainable AI capability development:

- **Adopt a shared capability framework**  
  Use a common structure to align learning, practice, and governance.

- **Design for roles, not tools**  
  Tailor capability development to responsibilities and decisions.

- **Invest beyond training**  
  Support communities of practice, mentoring, and reflection.

- **Surface and connect practice**  
  Make local innovation visible and shareable.

- **Align capability with governance**  
  Ensure learning connects to decision-making and oversight.

- **Plan for continuity**  
  Treat AI capability as an ongoing organisational responsibility.

---

## 6. Signals of mature organisational AI capability

Organisations with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- consistent language and expectations across roles  
- confidence rather than anxiety around AI use  
- reduced dependence on individual experts  
- visible ethical and equity considerations  
- learning embedded into everyday work  
- resilience to technological change  

These signals reflect organisational maturity, not technical advancement.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to organisational capability-building efforts.

To deepen this work, organisations may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- the Application Handbook for organisational pathways  
- Practice Guides related to leadership, governance, and professional development  
- facilitated capability assessments or design workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Organisational leaders provide conditions for sustainable capability.
