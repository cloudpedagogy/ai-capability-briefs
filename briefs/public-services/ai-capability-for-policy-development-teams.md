## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Policy Development Teams responsible for designing, reviewing, and advising on policy in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly influences evidence use, drafting processes, consultation, implementation, and evaluation.

It is intended for teams working across:

- institutional policy and strategy  
- public policy and regulation  
- sectoral guidance and standards  
- organisational policy frameworks  
- advisory and consultation processes  

This is not a policy template or an AI governance manual.  
It is a capability briefing to support sound judgement, legitimacy, and defensible policy-making when AI becomes part of policy work.

---

## 2. Why AI capability matters for policy development

AI is already influencing policy work by:

- accelerating drafting and redrafting  
- synthesising evidence and consultation responses  
- modelling scenarios and impacts  
- shaping how policy options are framed  

While these uses can increase efficiency, they also raise risks:

- policy rationales becoming opaque  
- evidence being flattened or misinterpreted  
- assumptions embedded in AI outputs going unchallenged  
- legitimacy and trust being undermined  

AI capability enables policy teams to use AI without weakening accountability, transparency, or democratic legitimacy.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for policy teams

Across policy environments, recurring challenges appear:

- **Unexamined synthesis:** AI summaries replacing critical engagement with evidence  
- **Framing bias:** policy options subtly shaped by model assumptions  
- **Opacity:** difficulty explaining how AI-informed analysis influenced outcomes  
- **Over-standardisation:** generic language eroding contextual nuance  
- **Consultation distortion:** AI-mediated analysis masking minority or marginal voices  
- **Responsibility drift:** unclear accountability for AI-influenced policy choices  

These risks arise when AI use is implicit rather than governed by capability.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in policy development

The AI Capability Framework provides a structured way to integrate AI into policy work responsibly.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Policy teams need realistic understanding of how AI affects policy analysis and drafting.

This includes:

- recognising limitations in AI-generated synthesis  
- understanding how models frame problems and solutions  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are neutral  

This domain supports critical policy reasoning, not automation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Policy accountability must remain human-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring policy judgements are owned by people, not systems  
- clarifying where AI informs versus determines choices  
- retaining deliberation and challenge in decision processes  

Clear co-agency safeguards legitimacy.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in policy work when used carefully.

This domain enables:

- exploratory scenario testing  
- rapid iteration of drafts  
- synthesis across complex inputs  

Innovation is beneficial when AI outputs are inputs to deliberation, not substitutes for it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Policy decisions have societal consequences.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- scrutinising whose perspectives are amplified or lost  
- considering equity and distributional impacts  
- anticipating downstream effects of AI-informed policy  

Ethical policy-making requires active foresight.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Policy development is a governance activity.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced analysis or drafting  
- ensuring traceability of policy rationale  
- aligning AI use with institutional or regulatory expectations  

Good governance supports defensibility and trust.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Policy environments evolve continuously.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review the impact of AI on policy quality  
- update practices as norms and tools change  
- learn from feedback and implementation outcomes  

This domain supports adaptive and resilient policy-making.

---

## 5. Practical actions for policy development teams

The following actions strengthen AI capability in policy contexts:

- **Make AI use explicit**  
  Surface where and how AI supports policy work.

- **Protect deliberation**  
  Ensure human discussion and challenge remain central.

- **Interrogate synthesis**  
  Treat AI summaries as starting points, not conclusions.

- **Document rationale**  
  Record how evidence and AI inputs shaped decisions.

- **Attend to equity**  
  Check whose voices may be underrepresented.

- **Review and adapt**  
  Treat AI use as subject to continuous improvement.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in policy development

Policy teams with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent use of AI in analysis and drafting  
- clear human ownership of policy decisions  
- robust engagement with evidence and consultation  
- defensible and explainable policy rationales  
- sensitivity to equity and impact  
- learning-oriented policy cycles  

These signals reflect policy legitimacy and maturity, not technical sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to policy development work.

To deepen this approach, policy teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on governance and decision-making  
- the Application Handbook for policy integration pathways  
- facilitated policy design or review workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Policy teams provide judgement, legitimacy, and accountability.
