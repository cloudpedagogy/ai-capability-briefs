## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for civil servants and public administrators working in government, public agencies, and arm’s-length bodies where artificial intelligence increasingly supports analysis, drafting, service design, and decision-making that affects citizens and communities.

It is intended for roles involved in:

- policy implementation and service delivery
- programme management and operational planning
- evidence synthesis and briefing for ministers or executives
- regulatory administration and public accountability
- cross-departmental coordination and reporting

This is not a technology strategy or a digital transformation plan.  
It is a capability briefing to support legitimacy, accountability, and sound public judgement when AI becomes part of public administration.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in public administration

AI is already shaping public administration through:

- briefing preparation and policy summarisation
- data analysis and performance monitoring
- service triage and prioritisation
- forecasting, modelling, and scenario planning
- citizen communication and engagement

These uses promise efficiency and consistency, but public administration carries distinctive obligations:

- decisions must be explainable and justifiable
- actions are subject to scrutiny, audit, and legal challenge
- impacts are unevenly distributed across populations
- public trust is fragile and cumulative

AI capability ensures that AI supports democratic governance, rather than undermining transparency, fairness, or accountability.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for civil servants

Across public-sector contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Procedural over-reliance:** treating AI outputs as neutral inputs to process.
- **Opacity creep:** difficulty explaining AI-influenced decisions clearly.
- **Policy–delivery disconnect:** AI practices drifting from stated intent.
- **Equity erosion:** algorithmic processes amplifying disadvantage.
- **Responsibility diffusion:** unclear ownership of AI-influenced outcomes.
- **Reputational exposure:** AI use becoming controversial after the fact.

These risks arise when AI use outpaces governance capability.

---

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in public administration

The AI Capability Framework offers a stable lens for responsible public-sector practice.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Civil servants need realistic understanding of how AI affects administrative judgement.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty and bias in AI-supported analysis
- understanding limitations of predictive or optimisation models
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are objective or definitive

This domain supports critical administrative judgement, not automation.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Public accountability must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain authority over decisions affecting citizens
- resisting pressure to defer to “system recommendations”
- being able to explain decisions independent of AI systems

Clear co-agency protects democratic responsibility.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support innovation in public administration when used carefully.

This domain supports:

- exploratory analysis to inform policy delivery
- improving efficiency in low-risk administrative tasks
- testing options while retaining human oversight

Innovation is legitimate when AI informs judgement rather than replaces it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Public administration carries distributive consequences.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining differential impacts across communities
- recognising how data reflects historical inequalities
- anticipating long-term societal consequences

Ethical public administration requires equity-aware AI use, not neutrality claims.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Governance is central to public administration.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced analysis or decisions
- aligning AI use with legal, ethical, and procedural frameworks
- maintaining clear audit trails and accountability

Good governance sustains legitimacy under scrutiny.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Public administration operates in evolving contexts.

Capability is strengthened when teams:

- review AI-influenced decisions over time
- learn from complaints, challenges, and outcomes
- adapt practices deliberately rather than defensively

This domain supports institutional resilience and trust.

---

## 5. Practical actions for civil servants and public administrators

The following actions strengthen AI capability in public administration:

- **Make AI use explicit**  
  Surface where AI informs analysis or decision-making.

- **Protect explanation**  
  Ensure decisions can be explained clearly to non-technical audiences.

- **Embed equity checks**  
  Assess who benefits and who may be disadvantaged.

- **Document rationale**  
  Record how AI inputs were weighed alongside other considerations.

- **Maintain human decision points**  
  Identify where human judgement must remain decisive.

- **Review and adapt**  
  Treat AI use as subject to continuous improvement.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in public administration

Public bodies with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent and explainable decision-making
- clear human accountability for outcomes
- sensitivity to equity and fairness
- confidence under audit or public scrutiny
- consistent practice across departments
- learning-oriented governance culture

These signals reflect democratic maturity, not technological sophistication.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to public administration and civil service practice.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)
- Practice Guides focused on governance and public impact
- the Application Handbook for institutional pathways
- facilitated workshops on AI and public accountability

The Framework provides structure.  
Civil servants provide public judgement, legitimacy, and trust.
