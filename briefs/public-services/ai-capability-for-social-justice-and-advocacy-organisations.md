## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for social justice, advocacy, and rights-based organisations working to influence policy, public discourse, and institutional practice in contexts where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes analysis, communication, mobilisation, and decision-making.

It is intended for organisations involved in:

- human rights advocacy and campaigning  
- equality, inclusion, and anti-discrimination work  
- community organising and movement building  
- policy critique and public accountability  
- legal, social, and cultural justice initiatives  

This is not a guide to digital campaigning tools or data analytics platforms.  
It is a capability briefing to support ethical judgement, movement integrity, and accountability when AI becomes part of justice-oriented work.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for social justice and advocacy

AI is increasingly used in advocacy contexts to:

- analyse policy, legislation, and public consultation data  
- draft campaign materials and public messaging  
- monitor media narratives and public sentiment  
- support strategic planning and coalition coordination  

While these uses can amplify reach and efficiency, justice-oriented work carries heightened risks:

- AI systems may reproduce structural bias and exclusion  
- automated analysis may silence marginalised voices  
- data-driven optimisation may distort movement priorities  
- opaque AI use may undermine trust with communities  

AI capability ensures that AI serves justice goals rather than reshaping them unintentionally.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in advocacy-related AI use

Across advocacy contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Voice dilution:** AI-generated messaging flattening lived experience  
- **Bias reinforcement:** data reflecting historical inequities shaping analysis  
- **Metric capture:** success defined by engagement analytics rather than justice impact  
- **Accountability gaps:** unclear responsibility for AI-influenced strategies  
- **Community trust risk:** affected groups unaware of AI’s role in advocacy work  
- **Ethical overload:** urgency crowding out reflection on AI use  

These risks arise when AI is introduced without values-led capability framing.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in social justice work

The AI Capability Framework provides a principled structure for justice-centred AI use.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Advocacy organisations need realistic understanding of how AI shapes narratives and analysis.

This includes:

- recognising how AI reflects dominant discourses and power structures  
- understanding limitations of sentiment or discourse analysis  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs represent community truth  

This domain supports critical political literacy, not technical adoption.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Justice work must remain human- and community-led.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring strategy and messaging decisions remain human-owned  
- resisting automation of moral or political judgement  
- clarifying where AI supports analysis versus shapes direction  

Clear co-agency protects movement autonomy and accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can support advocacy when used intentionally.

This domain supports:

- synthesising complex policy or consultation materials  
- exploring narrative framings for reflection and debate  
- supporting coordination without centralising control  

Innovation is valuable when AI supports collective sense-making, not replaces it.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Justice-oriented work demands heightened ethical sensitivity.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining whose voices are amplified or marginalised  
- recognising how AI may reproduce systemic injustice  
- prioritising consent, transparency, and dignity  

Ethical AI use is inseparable from justice commitments.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Advocacy organisations operate under public and moral scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI informs strategy or messaging  
- aligning AI use with organisational values and commitments  
- being prepared to explain and defend AI-supported choices  

Good governance sustains credibility with communities and allies.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Social justice work is dynamic and contested.

Capability is strengthened when organisations:

- reflect on how AI affects movement priorities  
- learn from unintended consequences  
- adapt practices in dialogue with affected communities  

This domain supports ethical resilience and legitimacy.

---

## 5. Practical actions for social justice and advocacy organisations

The following actions strengthen AI capability in justice-oriented contexts:

- **Centre lived experience**  
  Ensure AI-supported analysis does not displace community voices.

- **Interrogate data critically**  
  Question whose realities data represents.

- **Protect moral judgement**  
  Keep ethical and political decisions explicitly human-led.

- **Communicate transparently**  
  Be open about how AI supports advocacy work.

- **Align with values**  
  Ensure AI use reflects justice, inclusion, and accountability.

- **Reflect collectively**  
  Create space for dialogue on AI’s role in movements.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in social justice work

Advocacy organisations with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- values-led, transparent use of AI  
- protection of community voice and agency  
- ethical clarity under pressure  
- confidence in explaining strategy and methods  
- sensitivity to power and representation  
- learning-oriented movement practice  

These signals reflect justice-centred maturity, not technical prowess.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to social justice and advocacy practice.

To deepen this work, organisations may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on public-impact and high-risk contexts  
- the Application Handbook for ethics-led implementation  
- facilitated reflection workshops with communities and partners  

The Framework provides structure.  
Social justice organisations provide moral clarity, accountability, and change.
