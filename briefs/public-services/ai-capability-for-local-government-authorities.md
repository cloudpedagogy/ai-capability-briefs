## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for elected members, senior officers, and professional staff working within local government authorities where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes service delivery, decision support, prioritisation, and engagement with residents.

It is intended for local authorities involved in:

- service planning and delivery  
- resource allocation and prioritisation  
- regulatory, inspection, and enforcement functions  
- community engagement and public communication  
- partnership working across public and voluntary sectors  

This is not a technology procurement guide or a smart-city playbook.  
It is a capability briefing to support accountable judgement, democratic legitimacy, and defensible decision-making when AI becomes part of local public service delivery.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for local government

Local government sits at the front line of public trust. AI is increasingly used to:

- support eligibility and triage decisions  
- prioritise inspections or interventions  
- analyse population needs and service demand  
- assist communication with residents  
- optimise operational efficiency under constraint  

These uses can improve effectiveness, but they also raise acute risks related to fairness, transparency, and accountability. Decisions made locally are often:

- highly visible to communities  
- directly impactful on individuals’ lives  
- subject to political, legal, and media scrutiny  

AI capability ensures that local authorities use AI in ways that strengthen trust rather than erode it.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in local government AI use

Across local authorities, recurring challenges appear:

- **Opacity:** residents unable to understand how decisions were made  
- **Equity risk:** AI reinforcing existing social inequalities  
- **Responsibility blur:** unclear accountability between officers, vendors, and systems  
- **Procurement lock-in:** adopting tools without long-term governance clarity  
- **Policy drift:** AI use expanding beyond original intent  
- **Legitimacy challenge:** public perception of “automated government”  

These risks are magnified by constrained resources and complex service demands.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in local government

The AI Capability Framework provides a stable lens for responsible AI use in democratic, public-facing contexts.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Local authority leaders and staff need a shared understanding of how AI affects public decision-making.

This includes:

- recognising probabilistic and model-based outputs  
- understanding limits of prediction and scoring systems  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs are neutral or objective  

This domain supports informed public accountability.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Public authority decisions must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring officers and elected members retain decision authority  
- making accountability pathways explicit  
- rejecting narratives that shift responsibility to technology or suppliers  

Clear co-agency underpins democratic legitimacy.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Local authorities must innovate under constraint.

This domain supports:

- careful piloting of AI-enabled services  
- aligning innovation with local priorities and values  
- balancing efficiency with fairness and care  

Innovation is responsible when it is transparent and proportionate.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Local government decisions shape lived experience.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- anticipating differential impacts on communities  
- recognising structural disadvantage in data and models  
- embedding fairness and inclusion into service design  

Ethical use of AI is essential for public confidence.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Local authorities operate within strong governance frameworks.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influences decisions  
- aligning practice with legal, regulatory, and policy obligations  
- supporting scrutiny by councillors, auditors, and the public  

Good governance ensures defensibility under challenge.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Community needs and technologies evolve continuously.

Capability is strengthened when authorities:

- review outcomes of AI-enabled services  
- learn from complaints, appeals, and feedback  
- update practices in response to lived experience  

This domain supports adaptive, people-centred local government.

---

## 5. Practical actions for local government authorities

The following actions strengthen AI capability in local government contexts:

- **Be explicit about AI use**  
  Communicate clearly with residents and stakeholders.

- **Protect human judgement**  
  Ensure AI supports, not replaces, professional decision-making.

- **Assess equity impacts**  
  Examine who benefits and who may be disadvantaged.

- **Align procurement with governance**  
  Require transparency and accountability from suppliers.

- **Document decision pathways**  
  Maintain records that support scrutiny and appeal.

- **Review and adapt**  
  Treat AI use as subject to ongoing evaluation.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in local government

Local authorities with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent, explainable public-facing decisions  
- clear accountability and escalation routes  
- equity-aware service design  
- confidence under scrutiny and complaint  
- trust sustained with communities  
- learning-oriented service improvement  

These signals reflect democratic maturity, not technological ambition.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to local government contexts.

To deepen this work, authorities may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on public-sector and high-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for organisational implementation  
- facilitated cross-service capability reviews  

The Framework provides structure.  
Local government provides democratic accountability and public trust.
