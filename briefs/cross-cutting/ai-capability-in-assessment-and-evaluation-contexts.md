## 1. What this brief is for

This brief applies to professionals involved in assessment, evaluation, review, audit, or judgement across sectors where artificial intelligence increasingly supports evidence synthesis, scoring, comparison, or decision-making.

It is intended for contexts including (but not limited to):

- educational assessment and evaluation  
- research and programme evaluation  
- performance review and quality assurance  
- funding, grant, or application assessment  
- policy, service, or impact evaluation  

This is not a technical guide to automated assessment tools or scoring systems.  
It is a capability briefing to support fair judgement, defensible evaluation, and accountable decision-making when AI influences how evidence is interpreted and outcomes are determined.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in assessment and evaluation

Assessment and evaluation are trust-critical activities. AI is increasingly used to:

- synthesise large volumes of evidence or submissions  
- support scoring, ranking, or categorisation  
- identify patterns or risks across datasets  
- accelerate review processes under time pressure  

Decisions informed by assessment often:

- affect access to opportunity, funding, or progression  
- shape reputations and futures  
- carry legal, ethical, or public accountability  

Without explicit AI capability, assessment risks becoming:

- opaque or difficult to challenge  
- biased by data or model assumptions  
- overly procedural rather than judgement-led  
- vulnerable to legitimacy challenges  

AI capability ensures that AI supports evaluation without undermining fairness or trust.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported assessment

Across assessment contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **False objectivity:** AI outputs treated as neutral or definitive  
- **Criteria drift:** evaluation standards subtly reshaped by models  
- **Opacity:** limited explainability for assessed parties  
- **Over-automation:** efficiency gains overriding deliberation  
- **Bias amplification:** historical inequities reinforced by data  
- **Appeal fragility:** difficulty defending AI-influenced decisions  

These risks cut across education, research, governance, and public service.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in assessment contexts

The AI Capability Framework provides a consistent structure for judgement-led assessment across domains.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Assessors need a shared understanding of how AI processes and represents evidence.

This includes:

- recognising probabilistic scoring and clustering  
- understanding limitations in interpretation and nuance  
- avoiding assumptions that AI outputs equal evaluation  

This domain supports critical scrutiny, not procedural speed.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Assessment responsibility must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring final judgements rest with accountable decision-makers  
- treating AI as an advisory input, not an arbiter  
- being able to explain and justify decisions independently of tools  

Clear co-agency underpins fairness and legitimacy.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can enhance evaluation when used deliberately.

This domain supports:

- managing volume and complexity of evidence  
- supporting consistency across reviewers  
- enabling exploratory analysis alongside human judgement  

Innovation is appropriate when it preserves deliberation.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Assessment decisions shape life chances and organisational outcomes.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- examining differential impacts across groups  
- recognising bias embedded in criteria or data  
- ensuring assessment practices do not disadvantage already-marginalised parties  

Ethical assessment requires vigilance and care.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Assessment processes must be defensible.

AI capability here involves:

- documenting how AI influenced evaluation  
- aligning practices with legal, regulatory, or policy frameworks  
- supporting transparency, appeal, and review  

Good governance protects both assessors and assessed parties.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Assessment systems evolve.

Capability is strengthened when organisations:

- review outcomes and patterns over time  
- learn from appeals, complaints, or anomalies  
- refine criteria and AI use iteratively  

This domain supports credibility and continuous improvement.

---

## 5. Practical actions for assessment and evaluation contexts

The following actions strengthen AI capability in assessment roles:

- **Make criteria explicit**  
  Ensure standards are clear before AI is applied.

- **Treat AI outputs as advisory**  
  Preserve space for human judgement.

- **Support explainability**  
  Be able to justify decisions to those affected.

- **Monitor equity impacts**  
  Look for systematic disparities in outcomes.

- **Document reasoning**  
  Record how evidence and AI informed decisions.

- **Review and refine**  
  Treat assessment as a learning system.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in assessment and evaluation

Assessment systems with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- transparent, explainable decision-making  
- consistent yet judgement-led outcomes  
- resilience under appeal or scrutiny  
- ethical sensitivity to impact and equity  
- trust from participants and stakeholders  
- continuous refinement of practice  

These signals reflect assessment maturity, not automation depth.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) across assessment and evaluation contexts.

To deepen this work, teams may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides related to governance and decision-making  
- the Application Handbook for structured evaluation design  
- facilitated calibration or review workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Assessment contexts provide judgement, fairness, and legitimacy.
