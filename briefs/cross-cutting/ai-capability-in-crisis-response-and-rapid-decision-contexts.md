## 1. What this brief is for

This brief applies to professionals who make or support rapid, high-stakes decisions in crisis, emergency, or fast-moving situations where artificial intelligence increasingly informs situational awareness, prioritisation, or response.

It is intended for contexts including (but not limited to):

- emergency response and civil contingencies  
- organisational crisis management  
- health, safety, or safeguarding incidents  
- reputational, regulatory, or operational crises  
- time-critical leadership and coordination settings  

This is not a crisis management playbook or a technical guide to real-time AI systems.  
It is a capability briefing to support judgement, accountability, and ethical responsibility when AI is used under pressure and uncertainty.

## 2. Why AI capability matters in crisis and rapid decision contexts

AI is increasingly used in crisis situations to:

- analyse real-time or rapidly changing data  
- support triage, prioritisation, or allocation decisions  
- generate summaries, alerts, or situation reports  
- assist communication under time pressure  

Crisis decisions are often:

- irreversible or difficult to undo  
- made with incomplete information  
- highly consequential for people and organisations  
- scrutinised after the fact  

Without explicit AI capability, there is a heightened risk of:

- automation bias under stress  
- false confidence in AI outputs  
- responsibility being displaced onto systems  
- harm being amplified at scale  

AI capability ensures that AI supports *situational awareness*, not the abdication of judgement.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots in AI-supported crisis response

Across crisis contexts, recurring challenges appear:

- **Automation bias:** deferring to AI outputs under pressure  
- **False precision:** treating probabilistic insights as certainty  
- **Speed over scrutiny:** bypassing human review  
- **Responsibility diffusion:** unclear accountability for decisions  
- **Communication failure:** AI-generated messaging lacking context or care  
- **Crisis creep:** emergency AI practices becoming routine by default  

These risks are intensified by urgency and asymmetry of power over affected people.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in crisis contexts

The AI Capability Framework provides a stabilising structure for decision-making under extreme conditions.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Decision-makers need a realistic understanding of AI limitations in crises.

This includes:

- recognising uncertainty, latency, and data gaps  
- understanding that AI reflects inputs, not ground truth  
- avoiding assumptions that speed equals accuracy  

This domain supports vigilance rather than false reassurance.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Crisis accountability must remain human-owned.

AI capability here involves:

- ensuring humans retain final decision authority  
- explicitly assigning responsibility for AI-supported actions  
- resisting narratives that “the system decided”  

Clear co-agency protects legal, ethical, and moral accountability.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

AI can enhance crisis response when bounded appropriately.

This domain supports:

- decision support rather than decision replacement  
- scenario exploration and contingency planning  
- post-incident analysis and learning  

Innovation must be proportional to risk and reversibility.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Crisis decisions often affect vulnerable groups disproportionately.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- recognising how AI may prioritise or deprioritise populations  
- avoiding harm amplification through biased data  
- ensuring dignity and care under pressure  

Ethical responsibility does not diminish during crisis.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Crisis decisions are subject to later scrutiny.

AI capability here involves:

- maintaining defensible records of key decisions  
- aligning AI use with legal and governance frameworks  
- supporting review, inquiry, or accountability processes  

Good governance remains essential, even when speed is required.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Crisis capability depends on learning.

Capability is strengthened when organisations:

- review AI-supported decisions after incidents  
- identify near-misses and unintended consequences  
- refine protocols and safeguards  

This domain supports preparedness rather than complacency.

---

## 5. Practical actions for crisis and rapid decision contexts

The following actions strengthen AI capability under pressure:

- **Define non-negotiable human decision points**  
  Be explicit about where AI cannot decide.

- **Treat AI as advisory**  
  Use it to inform, not determine, action.

- **Make uncertainty explicit**  
  Communicate confidence and limitations clearly.

- **Assign responsibility clearly**  
  Ensure named decision-makers at all stages.

- **Document critical decisions**  
  Record rationale where feasible.

- **Review after action**  
  Treat AI use as part of post-incident learning.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in crisis contexts

Crisis systems with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- calm, judgement-led decision-making under pressure  
- clear accountability and command structures  
- cautious, proportionate use of AI  
- ethical sensitivity even in emergencies  
- resilience under inquiry or investigation  
- continuous improvement in preparedness  

These signals reflect crisis maturity, not technological intensity.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) across crisis and rapid decision contexts.

To deepen this work, organisations may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides for high-risk or public-impact contexts  
- the Application Handbook for governance alignment  
- scenario-based crisis simulation workshops  

The Framework provides structure.  
Crisis contexts demand judgement, care, and accountability.
