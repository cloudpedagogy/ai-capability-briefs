## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Educational Developers and academic development professionals who support teaching quality, curriculum design, assessment practice, and professional learning in contexts where artificial intelligence is increasingly embedded in educational work.

It is intended for roles such as:

- academic and educational developers  
- learning design and curriculum enhancement teams  
- teaching and learning centres  
- digital pedagogy and professional learning leads  

This is not a toolkit of AI teaching techniques.  
It is a capability briefing to support coherent guidance, confident facilitation, and defensible educational leadership when AI reshapes teaching and learning practice.

## 2. Why AI capability matters for educational developers

Educational developers sit at the translation layer of institutional change.

They are often asked to:

- interpret policy into practice  
- support staff uncertainty and experimentation  
- guide assessment redesign  
- facilitate professional conversations about AI  

Without clear AI capability, educational developers risk:

- being pulled into tool-specific training cycles  
- providing inconsistent or overly cautious guidance  
- absorbing institutional anxiety about AI without authority  
- responding reactively rather than shaping direction  

AI capability enables educational developers to anchor conversations in pedagogy, values, and learning outcomes — not tools or fear.

---

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for educational developers

Across institutions, recurring challenges appear:

- **Tool drift:** focus shifting from learning design to platform features  
- **Over-generalisation:** generic advice that does not translate across disciplines  
- **Assessment avoidance:** reluctance to engage deeply with assessment redesign  
- **Capability compression:** assuming short workshops equal readiness  
- **Boundary confusion:** unclear separation between guidance and governance  
- **Change fatigue:** staff overwhelmed by frequent AI-related messaging  

These issues arise when capability framing is missing.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability in educational development

The AI Capability Framework offers educational developers a stable, values-based structure for guiding change.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Educational developers need a shared pedagogical understanding of AI.

This includes:

- helping staff understand what AI can and cannot support in learning  
- demystifying AI behaviour without technical overload  
- reframing AI from “threat” to “design constraint”  

This domain supports pedagogical sense-making, not technical mastery.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Educational development is about clarifying roles.

AI capability here involves:

- supporting staff to articulate where student judgement is required  
- designing learning activities that foreground human reasoning  
- resisting narratives that position AI as a replacement for learning  

Clear co-agency strengthens educational intent.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Educational developers enable safe experimentation.

This domain supports:

- piloting AI-aware learning activities  
- facilitating reflective evaluation of what works  
- sharing practice across disciplines and teams  

Innovation is effective when grounded in learning outcomes and evidence.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Educational developers are stewards of inclusive practice.

AI capability in this domain includes:

- surfacing equity implications of AI-aware design  
- supporting accessible and transparent learning expectations  
- addressing how AI affects different student groups differently  

Ethical pedagogy requires intentional design, not assumption.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Educational development operates near governance boundaries.

AI capability here involves:

- aligning guidance with institutional policy and QA expectations  
- supporting defensible assessment and curriculum decisions  
- knowing when to escalate issues to governance bodies  

Good governance alignment protects credibility and trust.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Educational developers support long-term change.

This domain is strengthened when developers:

- create spaces for reflective practice  
- support communities of practice  
- adapt guidance as AI and pedagogy evolve  

Reflection prevents stagnation and reactive cycles.

---

## 5. Practical actions for educational developers

The following actions strengthen AI capability in educational development work:

- **Anchor guidance in learning outcomes**  
  Frame AI conversations around what students must demonstrate.

- **Shift focus from tools to design**  
  Emphasise pedagogy, assessment, and coherence.

- **Support staff confidence**  
  Provide language and frameworks, not prescriptions.

- **Facilitate shared learning**  
  Surface and connect local experimentation.

- **Align with governance early**  
  Ensure advice is consistent with QA and policy.

- **Design for continuity**  
  Treat AI capability as an ongoing developmental journey.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability in educational development

Educational development functions with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- consistent pedagogical framing across initiatives  
- confident engagement with assessment redesign  
- reduced staff anxiety and confusion  
- clear alignment between policy and practice  
- visible learning from experimentation  
- sustained professional dialogue about AI and learning  

These signals reflect educational leadership maturity, not technological enthusiasm.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to the work of educational developers.

To deepen this work, educational developers may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides focused on teaching and curriculum  
- the Application Handbook for facilitation pathways  
- structured workshops or design sprints  

The Framework provides structure.  
Educational developers provide pedagogical leadership and coherence.
