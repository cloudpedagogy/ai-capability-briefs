## 1. What this brief is for

This brief is for Module Convenors responsible for the design, delivery, and assessment of individual modules in contexts where artificial intelligence is now part of how students study, prepare, and produce work.

It is intended for staff who:

- design learning activities and assessments  
- interpret programme-level expectations locally  
- communicate guidance directly to students  
- support tutors, markers, and teaching assistants  

This is not a guide to AI tools or a set of rules for students.  
It is a capability briefing to support confident, consistent, and defensible module-level practice when AI is part of the learning environment.

## 2. Why AI capability matters at module level

Modules are where students most directly experience how AI is treated in practice.

At module level, AI influences:

- how students prepare for classes  
- how they draft and revise assessments  
- how they interpret feedback  
- how they understand academic expectations  

Because modules sit within programmes, inconsistency creates immediate problems:

- students receive mixed signals about acceptable AI use  
- assessment expectations become unclear  
- staff feel uncertain or exposed  
- minor design decisions escalate into integrity issues  

AI capability enables Module Convenors to translate programme-level intent into clear, fair, and pedagogically sound module practice.

## 3. Common risks and blind spots for Module Convenors

Across institutions, similar issues arise at module level:

- **Implicit expectations:** assumptions about AI use left unstated.  
- **Assessment vulnerability:** tasks easily completed through uncritical AI substitution.  
- **Over-restriction:** blanket bans driven by uncertainty rather than design intent.  
- **Inconsistent messaging:** guidance differing from parallel modules or previous years.  
- **Equity gaps:** students with lower digital confidence left unsupported.  
- **Reactive redesign:** changes made in response to incidents rather than reflection.  

These are design and communication challenges, not disciplinary ones.

## 4. Applying the six domains of AI capability at module level

The AI Capability Framework supports Module Convenors in making intentional, defensible choices.

### 4.1 AI Awareness & Orientation

Module Convenors need a realistic understanding of how AI affects student work in their discipline.

This includes:

- recognising which tasks are most affected by AI assistance  
- understanding common limitations of AI-generated content  
- avoiding assumptions that students use AI uniformly  

This domain supports informed design decisions, not technical expertise.

---

### 4.2 Human–AI Co-Agency

Modules define where learning responsibility sits.

AI capability here involves:

- clarifying where student judgement must be demonstrated  
- designing tasks that require interpretation, reasoning, or reflection  
- being explicit about appropriate and inappropriate AI use  

Clear co-agency reduces ambiguity and anxiety for students.

---

### 4.3 Applied Practice & Innovation

Module Convenors are often closest to pedagogical experimentation.

This domain supports:

- testing AI-aware learning activities safely  
- refining assessment prompts to emphasise thinking over output  
- sharing insights with programme teams  

Innovation works best when it is aligned with learning outcomes, not improvised.

---

### 4.4 Ethics, Equity & Impact

Module-level decisions shape student experience directly.

This includes:

- considering accessibility and differential access to support  
- recognising how unclear guidance can disadvantage some students  
- reflecting on how AI use aligns with disciplinary values  

Ethical capability ensures fairness is designed in, not assumed.

---

### 4.5 Decision-Making & Governance

Even at module level, decisions must be defensible.

AI capability in this domain involves:

- aligning module guidance with programme and institutional expectations  
- documenting rationale for assessment and design choices  
- knowing when to escalate issues to programme or faculty level  

Good governance protects both staff and students.

---

### 4.6 Reflection, Learning & Renewal

Modules evolve year to year.

Capability is strengthened when Module Convenors:

- review how AI-aware designs perform in practice  
- reflect on student feedback and outcomes  
- adjust guidance deliberately rather than reactively  

This domain supports continuous improvement rather than crisis response.

## 5. Practical actions for Module Convenors

The following actions support AI-aware module delivery:

- **Make expectations explicit**  
  State clearly how AI may or may not be used in module tasks.

- **Review assessment prompts**  
  Check whether tasks genuinely require student judgement.

- **Align with the programme**  
  Ensure module practice reflects shared programme-level principles.

- **Support student understanding**  
  Explain why expectations exist, not just what they are.

- **Document your rationale**  
  Keep brief records of AI-related design decisions.

- **Reflect after delivery**  
  Use experience to refine the module for the next iteration.

---

## 6. Signals of mature AI capability at module level

Modules with strong AI capability typically demonstrate:

- clear, consistent guidance for students  
- assessments aligned to learning outcomes  
- reduced confusion or disputes around AI use  
- confident communication by teaching staff  
- alignment with programme-level expectations  
- iterative improvement over time  

These signals reflect pedagogical confidence, not restriction.

## 7. How this brief fits within the AI Capability Framework

This brief applies the AI Capability Framework (2026 Edition) to the everyday work of Module Convenors.

To go further, Module Convenors may explore:

- the full AI Capability Framework (PDF)  
- Practice Guides related to teaching and assessment  
- programme-level guidance on AI-aware design  
- workshops or peer discussions focused on module design  

The Framework provides structure.  
Module Convenors provide pedagogical judgement and clarity.
